## Cut code-reading token costs by up to **99%**

Most AI agents explore repositories the expensive way:
open entire files → skim thousands of irrelevant lines → repeat.

**jCodeMunch indexes a codebase once and lets agents retrieve only the exact symbols they need** — functions, classes, methods, constants — with byte-level precision.

| Task                   | Traditional approach | With jCodeMunch |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Find a function        | ~40,000 tokens       | ~200 tokens     |
| Understand module API  | ~15,000 tokens       | ~800 tokens     |
| Explore repo structure | ~200,000 tokens      | ~2k tokens      |

Index once. Query cheaply forever.  
Precision context beats brute-force context.

**Stop dumping files into context windows. Start retrieving exactly what the agent needs.**

jCodeMunch indexes a codebase once using tree-sitter AST parsing, then allows MCP-compatible agents (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Google Antigravity, and others) to **discover and retrieve code by symbol** instead of brute-reading files.

Every symbol stores:
- Signature
- Kind
- Qualified name
- One-line summary
- Byte offsets into the original file

Full source is retrieved on demand using O(1) byte-offset seeking.

---

## Proof: Token savings in the wild

**Repo:** `geekcomputers/Python`  
**Size:** 338 files, 1,422 symbols indexed  
**Task:** Locate calculator / math implementations  

| Approach          | Tokens | What the agent had to do              |
| ----------------- | -----: | ------------------------------------- |
| Raw file approach | ~7,500 | Open multiple files and scan manually |
| jCodeMunch MCP    | ~1,449 | `search_symbols()` → `get_symbol()`   |

### Result: **~80% fewer tokens** (~5× more efficient)

Cost scales with tokens.  
Latency scales with irrelevant context.  

jCodeMunch turns search into navigation.

---

## Why agents need this

Agents waste money when they:

- Open entire files to find one function
- Re-read the same code repeatedly
- Consume imports, boilerplate, and unrelated helpers

jCodeMunch provides precision context access:

- Search symbols by name, kind, or language
- Outline files without loading full contents
- Retrieve exact symbol implementations only
- Fall back to full-text search when necessary

Agents do not need larger context windows.  
They need structured retrieval.

---

## How it works

1. **Discovery** — GitHub API or local directory walk  
2. **Security filtering** — traversal protection, secret exclusion, binary detection  
3. **Parsing** — tree-sitter AST extraction  
4. **Storage** — JSON index + raw files stored locally (`~/.code-index/`)  
5. **Retrieval** — O(1) byte-offset seeking via stable symbol IDs  

### Stable Symbol IDs

```
{file_path}::{qualified_name}#{kind}
```

Examples:

- `src/main.py::UserService.login#method`
- `src/utils.py::authenticate#function`

IDs remain stable across re-indexing when path, qualified name, and kind are unchanged.

Environment variables are optional:

| Variable            | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

## Usage Examples

```
index_folder: { "path": "/path/to/project" }
index_repo:   { "url": "owner/repo" }

get_repo_outline: { "repo": "owner/repo" }
get_file_outline: { "repo": "owner/repo", "file_path": "src/main.py" }
search_symbols:   { "repo": "owner/repo", "query": "authenticate" }
get_symbol:       { "repo": "owner/repo", "symbol_id": "src/main.py::MyClass.login#method" }

## Tools (11)

| Tool               | Purpose                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `index_repo`       | Index a GitHub repository   |
| `index_folder`     | Index a local folder        |
| `list_repos`       | List indexed repositories   |
| `get_file_tree`    | Repository file structure   |
| `get_file_outline` | Symbol hierarchy for a file |
| `get_symbol`       | Retrieve full symbol source |
| `get_symbols`      | Batch retrieve symbols      |
| `search_symbols`   | Search symbols with filters |
| `search_text`      | Full-text search            |
| `get_repo_outline` | High-level repo overview    |
| `invalidate_cache` | Remove cached index         |

Every tool response includes a `_meta` envelope with timing, token savings, and cost avoided:

```json
"_meta": {
  "timing_ms": 4.3,
  "tokens_saved": 48153,
  "total_tokens_saved": 1280837,
  "cost_avoided": { "claude_opus": 0.24, "gpt5_latest": 0.08 },
  "total_cost_avoided": { "claude_opus": 6.40, "gpt5_latest": 2.24 }
}
```

`total_tokens_saved` and `total_cost_avoided` accumulate across all tool calls and persist to `~/.code-index/_savings.json`.

---

## Recent Updates

**v0.2.8** — Estimated cost avoided added to every `_meta` response (`cost_avoided`, `total_cost_avoided`)
**v0.2.7** — Security fix: `.claude/` excluded from sdist; structural CI guardrails prevent credential bundling
**v0.2.5** — Path traversal hardening in `IndexStore`; `jcodemunch-mcp --help` now works
**v0.2.4** — Live token savings counter (`tokens_saved`, `total_tokens_saved` in every `_meta`)
**v0.2.3** — Google Gemini Flash support (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`); auto-selects between Anthropic and Gemini
**v0.2.2** — PHP language support

## Environment Variables

| Variable                    | Purpose                   | Required |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`              | GitHub API auth           | No       |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | Symbol summaries via Claude Haiku (takes priority) | No       |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY`            | Symbol summaries via Gemini Flash | No       |
| `CODE_INDEX_PATH`           | Custom cache path         | No       |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SHARE_SAVINGS`  | Set to `0` to disable anonymous community token savings reporting | No       |

### Community Savings Meter

Each tool call contributes an anonymous delta to a live global counter at [j.gravelle.us](https://j.gravelle.us). Only two values are ever sent: the tokens saved (a number) and a random anonymous install ID — never code, paths, repo names, or anything identifying. The anon ID is generated once and stored in `~/.code-index/_savings.json`.

To disable, set `JCODEMUNCH_SHARE_SAVINGS=0` in your MCP server env.
